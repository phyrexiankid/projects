This version of AdColony uses the Google Advertising ID, in order to use this you need to include the Google Play Services extension. In GGS->Android->Social, select Google Play Services,
this will add the extension to your project, then deselect it again if you do not have an App ID to use.

This version of the AdColony SDK enables haptic-enhanced videos and has thus had the Vibrate permission added. If you do not wish to allow this remove this permission from the list in the extension properties.
